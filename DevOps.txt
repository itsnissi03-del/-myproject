1.DevOps:
DevOps=Development + operation
it is a culture + set of practices + tools that help
developers (who write code)
operations ( who deploy/ manage systems)
work together instead of working in silos.
Real-Time example
imagine you're building a mobile app like  Swiggy
the developers writes code to add "track my order"
without DevOps: they give code to opposite team-> they manually deploy-> bugs happen -> delays
with DevOps : code is automatically tested & deployed-> customer get updated faster & safely
Develops help you
release feature faster ( new payment methods)
fix bugs quickly(login issues)
automate repetitive tasks(like server restarts, database backups)
2.8 phases of DevOps LIFE-CYCLE:
 plan - define what to build
 Develop - write the code
Build - compile code into deployable format
test - checks for bugs automatically
Release -  approach the build for deployment
Deploy - push app to server or app store 
Operate -  keep app running, fix any issues
Monitor -  analyze performance & feedback
  cycle continues: feedback to users -> back to plan
